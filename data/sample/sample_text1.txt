hi [USER], thanks for your attention!
yes that's a subtle typo that we were not able to correct in the paper.
your understanding is correct.
it should be x instead of z.

[USER] it's working now!
was missing to stringify the error to get the relavent info.
really appreciated!
could not make it without your help :)

due to the lazy loading, we need to provide our own search function so that the user can search the texts.
this function is necessary for both text-view and table-view.
we can provide two options: search by main text (root text) and search by text contained in the parallels.
my idea would be to develop this as an independent entity similar to the filter options and attach it to the filter panel.

describe the bug: i tried to re-download this https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/101953#osu/269773 map (even after reopening the game), but lazer keeps saying that the map _contains no hit objects_ (first screenshot).
you can see on the info wedge in map selection (second screenshot) that the map really contains nothing, but on stable it contains hit objects instead (third screenshot).
(note that it's a ranked map) for now, it seems the only map with this problem.

given a list of keywords, retrieve all the questions with tags related to them.
string similarity can be used, but exact matching is also ok.

currently i use sublime.
i use it because almost all the work i do is xml based with different languages in different fields.
for example: xml and java: [CODE] what i would like is a way to have the java be highlighted properly.
this is simple to do in sublime, but i've been searching for hours and can't find a way to do it in vscode.
simplicity of sublime: everything between <*source*> and <*/source*> is highlighed in java, while everything else is highlighted as xml [CODE]

i've had to manually update `.gitignore` in the release branch for the 2.1 release: [HASH] however, this could be done automatically by `bin/release.php`, just like it's done for jetpack: https://github.com/automattic/jetpack/blob/master/tools/build-release-branch.sh#l36 we'de need something similar in vaultpress.
